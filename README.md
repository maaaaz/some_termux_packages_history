Archive of old versions of some Termux packages
===============================================

Description
-----------
As Termux packages' old versions are [not kept](https://www.reddit.com/r/termux/comments/rjwzia/is_there_a_way_to_download_specific_package/) on [official repositories](https://packages.termux.dev/), this Github repository aims to archive several ones on `archive.org`.

Thanks to this project, termux packages are automatically backed up here [`https://archive.org/details/@archivetermux/uploads`](https://archive.org/details/@archivetermux/uploads) by their [package prefix convention](https://packages.termux.dev/apt/termux-main/pool/main/), meaning for instance that :
* The `bmon` package is backed up in `https://archive.org/details/termux_pkgs_archive_b`
* And the `libcap` package is backed up in `https://archive.org/details/termux_pkgs_archive_libc`

A list of all items on `archive.org` is available [here](https://archive.org/details/@archivetermux/lists/1/archive-of-termux-published-packages?sort=title).
